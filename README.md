# Task-7-PoojaP-
Basic Sales Summary from a Tiny SQLite Database using Python
This project is part of a Data Analyst Internship Task where the objective is to build a basic sales summary using SQL inside Python, and visualize the results using Matplotlib.

📘 Problem Statement Create a SQLite database and extract sales insights using SQL queries within Python. Display the output both via print statements and a simple bar chart. This is a fundamental task for understanding how SQL and Python work together for data analysis.

🧰 Tools Used Python 3 SQLite3 – built-in Python SQL engine Pandas – for handling dataframes Matplotlib – for plotting charts Google Colab – for executing everything in the cloud

💾 Dataset Details The sales data simulates transactions from a fictional store with the following schema:

Column Type Description id INTEGER Unique sale ID product TEXT Name of the product sold quantity INTEGER Quantity sold price INTEGER Price per unit (in ₹ INR) The dataset is manually created and inserted into a SQLite table named sales. Each row represents a product sale with:

product (name) quantity (units sold) price (per unit)
🧪 Sample Data used for task Product Quantity Price Smartwatch 2 5000 Headphones 3 3000 Hoodie 5 1200 Sneakers 4 2500 Smartwatch 1 5000 Hoodie 2 1200
📊 Chart Highlights: -📱 Smartwatch generated the highest revenue -👕 Hoodie had the highest quantity sold, but lower unit price -🎧 Headphones and 👟 Sneakers showed good performance

✨ Summary This project demonstrates how to integrate SQL with Python to perform basic data analysis on a sales dataset stored in a SQLite database. Using a fictional dataset, I queried total quantities and revenues by product, then visualized the revenue data with a clear and informative bar chart.

The key takeaways from this task include:

*Creating and querying a SQLite database using Python *Writing SQL queries to aggregate data *Loading SQL results into Pandas for further analysis *Plotting insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn *Presenting business insights clearly and visually This project showcases my ability to blend SQL, Python, and data visualization — core skills required for any entry-level data analyst role.
